# Water-quality-prediction
## introduction
This is a code about water quality prediction that uses three different multiple decomposition methods to improve the information leakage problem of CEEMDAN. At the same time, compared with the traditional temporal convolutional network (TCN) and attention mechanism (Attention), the TCN model adopts two-way multi-scale improvements, and the Attention mechanism also introduces a dependency matrix based on cosine similarity. This code uses the model structure of improved CEEMDAN-MSBTCN-BiLSTM-DMAttention.
